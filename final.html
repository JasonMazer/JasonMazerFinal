			<h3>What was the Problem with Baseball?</h3>

			<p>It is no secret that the popularity of baseball has declined over the last few years. The game was thought to be slow, boring, and lacking action. An average fan has strayed away from Baseball to watch sports that are more fast paced. In an attempt to make the game more exciting, the MLB introduced new rules for regular season games that could change the game of Baseball forever. </p>

			<h3>What Rules were Changed</h3>
			<p>The majority of the rules were put in place to help the offensive side of the game. Pitchers were now forced to abide by a 20 second pitch clock, giving them less time in between pitches. The MLB increased the size of the bases, hoping that teams will be more aggresive. They also put restrictions on defensive shifts which clearly helps the team at the plate. </p>

			<h3>Did the New Rules Work?</h3>
			<p>Their are two seperate answers to this question. First, we need to answer if the rules actually changed the game. The answer to this is an astounding yes. This year saw the shortest games in history along with the most stolen bases in 30 years. However, the main goal for these changes was to get viewership up. According to ESPN, the MLB saw an increase in viewership by 7% for a regular season game. This does not mean that the rules will work in the long run. The MLB needs to continue its innovation to make the game more excited and attract fans back to the sport. We will not know if the rules fully worked until five years from now, when the average viewers can be calulated once again. But the game is trending in the right direction for the first time in a while.</p>
