			<h2> How the MLB's New Rules Changed the Game of Baseball</h2>

			<h3>What was the Problem with Baseball?</h3>
			<p>Just a few decades ago, baseball was regarded as the most popular sport in the United States. In 1960, 34% of Americans said it was their favorite sport, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/07/sport/mlb-opening-day-baseball-popularity-spt-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a>. Today, just 11% like baseball the most. What used to be thought of as a game of precision and coordination, is now looked at as slow and boring. Sport fans prefer watching football players tackle each other at full speed, than praying for a home run to be hit. The game did not have action, there was too much time in between plays, and they lasted too long. The MLB was consistently losing viewers during the regular season. If this trend continued, professional baseball might have been extinct within the next 20 years. The league took matters into its own hands to make sure that never happened. In an attempt to bring eyes back to the game of baseball, the MLB introduced a few new rules for 2023 regular season games, hoping to make them more exciting. If successful, these rules could change the game of baseball forever.  </p>

			<h3>What Rules were Changed?</h3>
			<p>
The majority of the rules were put in place to help the offensive side of the game. Fans would rather watch 15 runs in a game instead of two in a short amount of time. The first rule is a pitch timer. A big reason why games lasted so long was because pitchers and batters would take their sweet time prior to a pitch. In the 2023 season, there was a 30-second timer in between batters, a 20-second timer in between pitches when runners were on base, and 15-seconds when there was no one on. Looking deeper into the rule, if a pitcher fails to deliver a pitch before the timer runs out and the batter is in the batter's box, it results in an automatic ball. If the batter does not get ready in time, it is an automatic strike. The MLB was hoping to decrease the overall time it took to complete a game. The second change came on defensive shifts. While there used to be no restriction, the 2023 season required a minimum of four players in the infield, with at least two playing on either sides of second base. In simple terms, the MLB was hoping it would become easier to get a hit by putting rules on where the defense can be. The final rule change was increasing the size of the bases. Home plate went unchanged, but all other bases were expanded from 15 inches square to 18. The league was hoping to get more action on the basebaths, along with giving players more room to operate. Prior to the 2023 MLB season, each of these rules were thoroughly tested in the Minor Leagues and made significant impacts. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred hoped they would have the same influence in the big leagues.

			<h3>Offensive Impact on the Game</h3>
			<p>As stated before, the majority of the rules were implemented to elevate the action. After one season, the offensive parts of the game increased as the league had hoped. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2023/10/04/how-did-the-rule-changes-impact-the-2023-major-league-baseball-season/?sh=ae8aca21c3b4" target="_blank">Forbes</a>, the 2023 season saw a higher batting average by five points, an increase of 8.6 to 9.2 in runs per game and over 600 more home runs than in 2022. These numbers were not substantial enough to stand out amongst the last ten years, but they are moving in the right direction. Nevertheless, some sides of the game were significantly affected. In the 2023 season, 3,500 bases were stolen. In the last ten years, the most SB's, or stolen bases, in a season was 2,764. This was 736 less than this past year. Compared to the average of the last eight seasons, 41.53% more bases were stolen in 2023. Statistics for the 2020 season are not included as the season was shortened due to the Coronavirus. Diving deeper into history, 3,500 stolen bases have not happened since 1987. It is safe to say that increasing the size of the bases had a direct effect. It is not possible to attribute all of these increases to the rule changes, as there are many outliers in the game of baseball. However, the MLB is happy with the trend of numbers, and believe they will continue to rise as teams get more comfortable with the changes.</p>

				<h3>Defensive Impact on the Game</h3>
			<p>While the offensive players are ecstatic with these new rules, the same can not be said for the defensive side. Peter Serrutto, a catcher for the minor league affiliates of the New York Yankees, is extremely unhappy with the changes. “For catchers specifically, these rules make our lives much harder,” Serruto said. “We have to get the signs to the pitcher so much faster, and it is tough to create a rhythm with the pitcher.” 2023 saw the highest pitching ERA over the last four full seasons with 4.33, as pitchers needed to adjust to less time in between pitches. “I need to make sure the pitcher stays relaxed and does not start rushing. The pitch clock does not allow them to complete their normal rituals before throwing, which most have done that their entire baseball careers.” However, there were over 1,000 more strikeouts in the 2023 season than in 2022. It may be the case of both the pitchers and hitters being affected by this new timer. Serrutto seemed particularly angry about one rule, and it is safe to say all catchers share the same feeling. “Don’t get me started on the new bases. 3,500 stolen bases this year correct? Yea that’s all I need to say.” Unfortunately, when the league wants to increase the action in the game, the defensive side is hindered. Catchers may be upset about the new rules, but the benefit for the league and its fans outweighs the negatives.</p>

			<h3>Did The MLB Accomplish Their Goal?</h3>
			<p>The MLB needed to make a change to make the depleting game of baseball more exciting. The overall goal for these rules was to increase viewership, and build a more innovative game. A key to this was to make the games shorter, and the pitch clock did the trick. Over the past ten seasons, the average length of time for a game was 3 hours and 10 minutes. In 2023, the mean duration was 24 minutes shorter, averaging 2 hours and 39 minutes per game. This could have resulted in the average attendance for a game increasing by 9.6% compared to 2022. It is the first time since 2017 that the total attendance surpassed 70 million. “I honestly felt a difference in energy since the rules were introduced,” Serrutto said. “Fans enjoy a fast paced game, and that is what baseball is turning into.” This translates to the screen as well, as TBS had a 41% increase in their midseason viewers. More eyes also leads to more money in the pocket of the league. The MLB’s ad revenue for regular season games jumped 6% in 2023, totaling $413.6 million, Forbes says. As the new game followed the MLB's vision in its inaugural season, baseball might change from America’s pastime, to its future.</p>
